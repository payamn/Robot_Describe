# Robot_Describe
Four different encoder-decoder models for translating sequence of laser data to natural language.
To generate data:


Install Stage-ROS

./python2 script/dataset_generator_1.py   # for the first dataset

./python2 script/dataset_generator_2.py	  # for the second dataset


To train different model you have to run read_data.py. You can change model version to train different models.
